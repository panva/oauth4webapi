â€¢ `const` **allowInsecureRequests**: unique `symbol`

By default the module only allows interactions with HTTPS endpoints. Setting this option to
`true` removes that restriction.

## Deprecated

To make it stand out as something you shouldn't use, possibly only for local
  development and testing against non-TLS secured environments.
