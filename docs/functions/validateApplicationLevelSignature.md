â–¸ **validateApplicationLevelSignature**(`as`, `ref`, `options?`): [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<`void`\>

Validates the JWS Signature of either a JWT [Response.body](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response/body) or
[TokenEndpointResponse.id\_token](../interfaces/TokenEndpointResponse.md#id_token) of a processed [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response)

> [!NOTE]\
> Validating signatures of JWTs received via direct communication between the Client and a
> TLS-secured Endpoint (which it is here) is not mandatory since the TLS server validation is used
> to validate the issuer instead of checking the token signature. You only need to use this method
> for non-repudiation purposes.

> [!NOTE]\
> Supports only digital signatures.
